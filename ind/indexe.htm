        <h1>About Me and My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>My name is Alexander Shirko, and I have been passionate about music since childhood. For several years I have been playing the guitar and recently started learning to play the piano, which allows me to expand my musical horizons and develop a sense of rhythm and harmony.</p>
        <p>In addition to my musical interests, I am deeply fascinated by technology and internet projects. I have experience participating in educational and scientific online initiatives, including the development of a cloud storage system for the educational process, which allowed me to combine practical skills with theoretical knowledge.</p>
        <p>I have also taken part in professional events and competitions related to IT and educational technologies, which gave me the opportunity to explore modern approaches to organizing learning processes and implementing innovative solutions in educational institutions.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy traveling and exploring new cultures. One of the most memorable trips I have taken was to Vladikavkaz — a city with a rich history and the unique atmosphere of the Caucasus. I visited local museums, learned about the region’s cultural traditions and architecture, tried traditional Ossetian cuisine, and met locals whose openness and hospitality truly impressed me. I was especially fascinated by the stunning mountain landscapes and the old streets of the city, where the connection between generations and the spirit of Caucasian culture are still alive. This journey not only broadened my horizons but also reminded me of the value of cultural diversity and genuine human communication.</p>
        <p>Among my home hobbies, I can mention a love for pets: I have an aquarium with various fish species, including guppies and tetraodons, and I am also interested in pet training. These hobbies help me develop patience, attention to detail, and a sense of responsibility.</p>
        <p>This section aims to highlight not only my professional interests but also the hobbies that shape my personality. I hope my experience and interests can be both useful and inspiring to others.</p>
